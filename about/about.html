        <p>Edu media is a mass media service to provide education to students in the form of learning tips and tricks, health, thought patterns
            and hobbies, all of which are displayed in an article that has been written by several great students who are experienced in their 
            fields. We hope the content What we present can provide benefits to readers.</p>
        <p>The main reason this website was created was to fulfill the final assignment of the first semester at Asia Cyber University.
            With several team members that we have, we are determined to make this website as attractive as possible so that we can get
            satisfactory grades.
            </p>
        <p>The process of creating this website also places great importance on the quality of the UI and the content that is loaded. We have 
            held several meetings on the Zoom application to start making plans and dividing tasks between each member.
            </p>
        <p>In this project, our group consists of 4 people, namely Farhan, Revi, Abdul and Reynold. Each of them is an expert in creating websites
            and is familiar with using existing technology. </p>
